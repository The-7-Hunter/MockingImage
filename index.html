            <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
            <p id="intro"> IavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. IavaScript is extremely
                popular for
                a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to
                provide programmatic control over
                them.

                    <p> Variable Declaration </p>
                    IavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
                    the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
                    unique names are called identifiers. oar x;

                <li id="paragraph">
                    <p> Variable Assignments </p>
                    Assignment operators assign values to IavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in
                    it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;
                </li>
                <li id="paragraph">
                    <p> Data Type</p>
                    Data types are an important concept to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data
                    type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or
                    3.14159; Sting - "Coding Dojo Rocks!" ;
                    Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_nameâ€¢ lane', last_name: 'Doe'}

                <li id="paragraph">
                    <p> Conditionals </p>
                    When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting
                    different code blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to
                    specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of
                    code;
                </li>
                <li id="paragraph">
                    <p> Loops </p>
                    There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do
                    the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four
                    times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                </li>
                <li id="paragraph">
                    <p> Functions </p>
                    Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code
                    block. Think of it as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instruction manual and get started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and
                    over again.
